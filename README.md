# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The objective of this Project is to examine PyBer’s 2019 ride-sharing data, to help the company improve access to ride-sharing services and to determine its affordability at various city types. The project helped to review and create a data frame that contains ride sharing details by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural) and driver count in the various cities in the region. The data from the 2 datasets were merged into a single data frame using the city name. The goal is to visualize the number of rides and the average fares for each city type. With a multiple line graph, we can track the trends in total weekly fare for each city type over the course of time which demonstrates how much fare is earned weekly in each city type and in what manner it changed over time. This can be used to identify disparities in pay for drivers and for rides by each city type. The analysis would help us to put forward recommendations to enhance the business.

## Results
The ride-sharing data among different city types was used to calculate different aspects such as:

•	**Total Rides** - Based on the data provided, we were able to determine that there was a larger demand for PyBer ride services among the urban cities, compared to suburban and rural cities. The above graph indicates that the Urban cities contributed about 1,625 rides in total to PyBer's rides overall over the five-month period.

•	**Total Drivers** - As per the information, there are around 2,405 drivers count in Urban regions which is more than double the driver counts from Rural and Suburban regions. The urban drivers do better financially based on the above table because the number of rides is higher.

•	**Total Fares** - Even though the price fares are lower in Rural regions, the ride count was substantially high in Urban regions, and hence it generated the maximum revenue, compared to suburban and rural regions. It also emphasis the relation between the highest number of total drivers and total rides availed in the urban region. 

•	**Average Fare per Ride and Driver** - The average fare per ride is $34.62 for rural regions, $30.97 for suburban regions, and $24.53 for urban regions. And finally, the average fare per driver is $55.49 for rural regions, $39.50 for suburban regions, and $16.57 for urban regions.
The above demonstrates that the average fare per ride is higher for rural drivers in comparison to suburban drivers, $3.65 more, and in comparison, to urban drivers, $10.09 more. The average fare per ride for suburban drivers is $6.44 higher than urban drivers. Likewise, the average fare per driver is higher for rural drivers in comparison to suburban drivers, $15.99 more, and in comparison, to urban drivers, $38.92 more. The average fare per driver for suburban drivers is $22.93 higher than urban drivers. 

It demonstrates that rural drivers are paid more as a whole per driver in comparison to suburban and urban drivers, and urban drivers are the lowest paid for each individual driver. Also, rural drivers are paid more for each ride, so their payment per ride, in comparison to suburban and urban drivers, and urban drivers are the lowest paid if each ride is judged the relevant unit of account for working in the ride sharing industry. This per driver analysis clearly contrasts with the whole total fare graphical perspective which seems to demonstrate that urban drivers as a unit are paid better than suburban and rural drivers as a unit.

•	**Total Fare by City Type** - The below line chart enlightens us that the total fare by city type from January to April 2019. The rides and the total fares are the highest for Urban region, followed by Suburban and finally by Rural region. The company has to identify the reason for the low income from rural regions and work on improving the performance by providing more training.

## Summary

Based on the results, here are some of the business recommendations to the CEO for tackling disparities among the city types:

•	The Urban region has the maximum total fares and the greatest number of rides, as a result they constitute majority of the company's generated revenue. Therefore, this is the highest performing city type, and we will have to spend more in this type in order to bring significant profits to PyBer in the near future. 

•	The Rural regions constitutes the lowest ride and total fare amount. The surprising fact is that the average fare per trip is the highest in this city type, so increasing passenger numbers in this city type can increase revenue slightly. Regardless of having the smallest count of drivers, the average fare per driver is the highest in this type of city. Therefore, if you can increase passenger numbers through investment in more promotional activities to attract or motivate the target audience to avail the ride service. Discounted ride fares for people who usually avail the service and introductory rates for new customers is also a good option.

•	Regular periodic evaluation of drivers in Urban region would be beneficial because as per the summary above the number of drivers is more than the number of rides taken. The analysis would be more accurate if we could remove the inactive or idle drivers from the list.
